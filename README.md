## LinkedIn Word Game

This is the client side application built in React for a word guessing game, which can be played by a user "against" the
computer. This is a game where the secret-keeper (in this case, the computer) thinks of a
word, and the guesser (the user) tries to guess it one letter at a time. The guesser has six
guesses. If the guesser guesses a letter which is part of the word, the secret-keeper will reveal
all occurrences of that letter in the word. If the guesser guesses a correct letter such that all
letters are now revealed, the game is over and player 2 has won. Instead if player 2 runs out of
guesses before the whole word is discovered, the game is over and player 1 has won. Check
out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game) for more details.

### Backend
Here is the [backend](https://github.com/ausyau/word-game-server) for the backend server

### Game Rules
- At the start of the game the computer/secret-keeper will choose a dictionary word
- The guesser loses the game if they guess 6 letters that are not in the secret word
- The guesser wins the game if they guess all letters in the secret word correctly and have not already lost the game per the conditions above

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
